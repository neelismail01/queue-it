# Queue It

## Technologies
The user interface of this application was built with Swift and SwiftUI and integrated with Apple's MusicKit API to provide access to its music catalogue. Persistant storage and real-time queue syncing was achieved using Firebase Firestore.

## Features:
  * Connect your Apple Music account to gain access to Apple Music's catalogue of 50+ million songs and play music
  * Create queues and invite others to join and contribute
  * Search songs, artists, and albums through a search preview 
  * Play music from any connected device controlled by the queue's owner
  * Control music playback using familiar controls such as play/pause, skip, and play previous
